Learning Loops within RStudio

# Flow control in R

# Conditonal statement in R
# Let x1 be some value and we want to test if x1 is 25 or more
# If x1 >= 25, we want to print a message that x1 is 25 or more using message() function
x1 <- 20

if(x1 >= 25)
{
  message("x1 is 25 or more")
}

# if we want to print a different message when x1 < 25, the else part can be used
if(x1 >= 25)
{
  message("x1 is 25 or more")
} else
{
  message("x1 is less than 25")
}

### in the above, please note that the else is written right next to 
### the closing braces of the first part on the same line

# let us do a different example with more than two options 
# let x1 be quantity bought and we want to compute discount as follows
# discount = 10% if qty < 10, 15% if qty between 10 & 25, 20% if more than 25

if(x1 < 10)
{
  discount <- 0.10
  message("Discount is 10%")
} else if(x1 < 25)  # note that by being in this part, x1 can only be more than 10
{
  discount <- 0.15
  message("Discount is 15%")
} else              # no need to test if x1 >= 25, since this part is 25 or more
{
  discount <- 0.20
  message("discount is 20%")
}

# if you want to start with highest discount, then the sequence is as follows
if(x1 >= 25)
{
  discount <- 0.20
  message("Discount is 20%")
} else if(x1 >= 10)  # this part is < 25 and includes < 10, so we test this way
{
  discount <- 0.15
  message("Discount is 15%")
} else
{
  discount <- 0.10
  message("Discount is 10%")
}

# Repeated statements with loop
# print a message 5 times with a while loop, 
# with a variable i starting at 1 and increasing everytime inside the loop
i <- 1
while(i <= 5)
{
  message("this is message number ", i)
  i <- i + 1
}

# use of while loop where variable j starts at 10 and decreases everytime inside the loop
j <- 10
while(j >= 1)
{
  message("this is message number ", j)
  j <- j - 1
}


# for loop, when the number of times for the loop is pre-determined
# so, there is no need to increase of decrease the value of the index
# the statement "i in 1:5" means for each loop, i takes on each value in the sequence
# i.e., i is 1 first time, 2 the second time, 3 the third time, and so on until 5
for(i in 1:5)
{
  message("this is message number ", i)
  
}

# the above loop can be done in reverse order, say from 10 through 1
for(i in 10:1)
{
  message("this is message number ", i)
}

# another example with for loop
# here i takes on each letter of the alphabet up to the 10th letter
# i.e., i is "a" first time in loop, "b" second time, and so on until "j"
for(i in letters[1:10])
{
  message("The letter is ", i)
}
