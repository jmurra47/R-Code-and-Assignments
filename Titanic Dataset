# Assign the dataset "Titanic" to a new data frame variable named appropriately. Display the structure of the data frame.
class(Titanic)
titanic.df <- data.frame(Titanic)
titanic.df

# 2.	Display the number of rows, number of columns, and the column names of the new data frame.
nrow(titanic.df)
ncol(titanic.df)

# 3.	From the Titanic data frame, select and display the data according to each of the specifications below:
#     a.	All the columns for passengers who survived.
titanic.df[titanic.df$Survived == "Yes", ]

#     b.	All the columns for passengers who survived and the number survived was 100 or more.
titanic.df[(titanic.df$Survived == "Yes") & (titanic.df$Freq >= 100), ]

#    c.	The columns Class, Age, Survived, and Freq for passengers in "1st" or "2nd" class.
titanic.df[(titanic.df$Class == "1st") | (titanic.df$Class == "2nd"), c("Class", "Age", "Survived", "Freq")]

#    d.	The columns Class, Survived, and Freq for Female passengers who were adults.
titanic.df[(titanic.df$Sex == "Female") & (titanic.df$Age == "Adult"), c("Class", "Survived", "Freq")]

# 4.	Another built-in dataset is "mtcars" which is data on cars from Motor Trends. 
# Assign the dataset "mtcars" to a new data frame variable named appropriately. Display the structure of the data frame.
mtcars.df <- data.frame(mtcars)
str(mtcars.df)

# 5.	Display the number of rows and number of columns of the above data frame. Display the column names of the above data frame.
nrow(mtcars.df)
ncol(mtcars.df)
colnames(mtcars.df)

# 6.	From the above data frame, select and display the data according to each of the specifications below:
#     a.	All the columns for 6 cylinder cars with horsepower greater than or equal to 100. 
#         Add R code to display the number of cars selected with the above condition.
# For this problem, since the selected data is to be also counted for number of rows, I assign the selection to a variable & display the variable
(mtcars.select <- mtcars.df[(mtcars.df$cyl == 6) & (mtcars.df$hp >= 100), ])
nrow(mtcars.select)

#     b.	All the columns for cars with mpg 20 or more and with 5 gears.
mtcars.df[(mtcars.df$mpg >= 20) & (mtcars.df$gear == 5), ]

# c.	The columns mpg, cyl, disp, and hp for cars with weight greater than 3000 lbs.
mtcars.df[(mtcars.df$wt > 3), c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "hp")]

# d.	The columns cyl, wt, am, gear and carb for 4 cylinder cars with displacement of less than 100 cubic inch.
mtcars.df[(mtcars.df$cyl == 4) & (mtcars.df$disp < 100), c("cyl", "wt", "am", "gear", "carb")]
