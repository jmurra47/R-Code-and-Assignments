Loop In-Class Work

# x1 is the variable stating the weight of a package to be shipped by grams
# sc is the shipping cost variable

# when x1 < 100, sc is $1.50
# when x1 is between 100 and 250, sc is $2.50
# when x1 is between 250 and 500, sc is $3.50
# when x1 is 500 or greater, sc is $5.00

# for example, if we make x1 equal to 200 to test a value (not required in instructions)

x1 <- 200

if(x1 < 100)
{
  sc <- 1.50
  message("shipping cost is $1.50")
} else if(x1 < 250)
{
  sc <- 2.50
  message("shipping cost is $2.50")
} else if(x1 < 500)
{
  sc <- 3.50
  message("shipping cost is $3.50")
} else
{ 
  sc <- 5.00
  message("shipping cost is $5.00")
}

# because 200 is greater than 100gm and less than 250 gm, the sc is $2.50



# create a vector of full names of the months in a year

# name of the month

  message("The month is: ", month.full)
}

# create a loop to show the number of characters in the month's names
